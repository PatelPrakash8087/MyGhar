<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

MARK-3 is an educational Unity 3D game designed to introduce students to the world of coding through a space-themed interactive experience. In this game, students will embark on an intergalactic journey as they become space pilots, navigating their spacecraft through challenging cosmic terrains to reach their destination.

The core concept of the game revolves around using block-based programming to plan the route for the spaceship. Instead of traditional lines of code, the students will use a drag-and-drop system that employs visual blocks of statements, making coding concepts more accessible and engaging for beginners.

### Features

1. `Intuitive User Interface`: The game will offer a user-friendly interface with a <b>toolbox</b> of programming blocks that students can use to create a series of actions for the space ship.

2. `Cosmic Adventures`: Students will explore a <b>visually stunning</b> and diverse interstellar environment, featuring planets, asteroids, nebulae, and other celestial objects, each presenting unique challenges for route planning.

3. `Block-Based Route Planning`: By <b>dragging</b> and connecting coding blocks, students will define the ship's route, including movement, rotations, and interactions with the environment.

4. `Progressive Difficulty`: The game will offer a gradual learning curve, introducing new coding concepts and challenges as players advance through the <b>levels</b>.

5. `Real-Time Feedback`: Students will receive <b>instant feedback</b> on their code blocks, allowing them to debug and optimize their routes for efficiency and accuracy.

6. `Creative Freedom`: The game will <b>encourage creativity</b>, allowing students to experiment with different coding approaches and refine their problem-solving skills.

7. `Gamified Learning`: Students will earn rewards as they complete levels, providing a sense of accomplishment and <b>motivation</b> to continue learning.
